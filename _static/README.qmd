The framework `neermatch` provides a set of tools for entity matching based on deep learning, symbolic learning, and a hybrid approach combining both deep and symbolic learning. It is designed to support easy set-up, training, and inference of entity matching models. The package provides automated fuzzy logic reasoning (by refutation) functionality that can be used to examine the significance of particular associations between fields in an entity matching task.

The `neermatch` framework encompasses three packages:

1. `py-neer-match`: The `Python` implementation of the basic functionalities. [Learn more](https://py-neer-match.pikappa.eu)
2. `py-neer-utilities`: A `Python` package that provides additional functionalities to streamline and support the entity matching workflow. ([this project](https://www.marius-liebald.com/py-neer-utilities/index.html))
3. `r-neer-match`: The `R` implementation of the basic functionalites. [Learn more](https://github.com/pi-kappa-devel/r-neer-match)

The project is financially supported by the [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft](https://www.dfg.de/de) (DFG) under Grant 539465691 as part of the Infrastructure Priority Programme [*New Data Spaces for the Social Sciences*](https://www.new-data-spaces.de/en-us/) (SPP 2431). Reading the article [*Karapanagiotis and Liebald (2023)*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4541376) helps to understand the theoretical foundation and design of `neermatch` (note that the article refers to an earlier version of the framework, previously labeled as `mlmatch`).
